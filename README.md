![Metatobac logo with numbers showing the lines in order](/Assets/logo_tutorial.png)
+ Two paralell diagonal lines following the top left -> Bottom right direction ([1] and [2])
    - These lines must be centered, with a gap in between
+ One line perpendicular to the bottom paralell line ([3])
    - This line must be centered, both with the whole logo and the bottom paralell line ([1])
    - This line must be in contact with [1]
    - The topmost extremity of this line should be on the center point of [1], while the other should be the corner of an invisible 90 degree angle formed between the extremities of [1]
    - If the rules are followed properly, the line should follow the top right -> Bottom left direction
+ One line perpendicular to the top paralell line ([4])
    - This line must be centered, both with the whole logo and the top paralell line ([2])
    - This line must be in contact with [2]
    - The bottom extremity of this line should be on the center point of [2], while the other should be the corner of an invisible 90 degree angle formed between the extremities of [2]
    - If the rules are followed properly, the line should follow the top right -> Bottom left direction and be paralell to and on the same axis as [3]
+ One vertical line ([5]) connecting lines [2] and [4]
    - This line should connect to the bottom right extremity of line [2] and the top right extremity of line [4]
    - If the instructions were followed properly, this line should be at a 45 degree angle from [2]
If all instructions were followed properly, congratulations! You have made a Metatobac logo. If you discover any loopholes, feel free to open a Github issue.
